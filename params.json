{"name":"IQStack","tagline":"Put the IQ back in your Stack.","body":"### IQStack\r\nThe IQStack project is made up of several sub-projects that relate to distributed automation and configuration management that is simple, fast and powerful. To make it simple we approach the design in a layered approach with each layer being more abstract and more opinionated. Think of it akin to a Cloud environment where you have IaaS, PaaS and SaaS layers with each taking advantage of the layers below but being able to access code from any layer.\r\n\r\n## Under heavy development\r\nNot all parts are available for public access at this time but will be soon. \r\n\r\n## Languages used\r\nImportant: In today's environments there are no longer a single anything. Meaning, we live in a polygot world in the DevOps community and thus IQStack thinks of programming languages as a tool. IQStack's primary language is Go but the complete list is:\r\n\r\n1. Go for its speed, true concurrency, compiled code and single file distribution.\r\n2. Python for its simplicity and rich toolset.\r\n3. Shell scripts because you can't really live without them no matter how hard you try :).\r\n4. Jsonnet! We have adopted Jsonnet (Google project) which is a powerful and flexible templating language in Json. See more below.\r\n\r\n## Project\r\nIf you would like to checkout the whole project then simply clone https://github.com/iqstack or better yet, learn more about the project by contributing. Simply fork the sub-project or the whole project and begin making contributions. \r\n\r\n## Story\r\nMy name is Chris Jones and I have worked at many large enterprises such as Bloomberg, Turner Broadcasting (CNN, TBS, etc), Internap. I have also work in contracting roles for Cisco, AT&T, MLB, Accenture and a lot more. I have been in development, systems engineering, architecting and management throughout my career. I remember the days of using installers to generate custom Windows MSIs and just plain tar balls on Linux (before good package management). The point is we continue to search for better ways to control our fleets of bare metal, appliances, routers/switches, public and private cloud environments in a pipeline oriented way that is as structured as our given organization or group can handle.\r\n\r\nOver the last 5+ years we all have seen good projects like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, SaltStack and others born. I have personally used all of them in some capacity or another. However, no matter what large organization you find yourself in there are always different groups using different products to help manage their infrastructure (application or environment) even if the company policy is to use only one. It typically boils down to \"I like Ansible and SaltStack because they're Python or I like Puppet or Chef because they're Ruby.\" Also, everywhere is going to have some kind of home-grown dark magic piece of code that \"Bob\" wrote a few years ago and no one wants to touch it out of fear of having to support it.\r\n\r\nIn my current role I use Chef and Ansible on a daily basis (one I like and one I'm forced to like). I also support other projects that use Puppet and a sprinkle of Salt as well. There are some things that each of these do very well and other tasks they are horrible at. My goal with this project is to take the \"good\" from each, fix the \"bad\" and just get rid of the \"ugly\".\r\n\r\nIn my current environment I have outside Cloud services (AWS and Google Compute) plus VERY large OpenStack clusters with VERY large distributed Object Storage (Ceph) clusters. We have to use multiple products because not one of the ones I have mentioned can do everything we need well. They keyword is well. The given product may be able to do 'something' but it may take more work because it maybe simply not built for dynamic modern infrastructures (platform and application) in a distributed environment where you need to version, upgrade, rollback and/or patch easily.\r\n\r\nMore to come...","google":"UA-38455669-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
